Time to learn coding for a dream jobb I want:)

OK, so for the jobb i am looking at they have a lot of focus on JavaScrip.
  while I in practice does not have any experience with JavaScript
  So I want to do the best I can to learn it so that i can show of that I have potential to learn.
   
Now there is a big challenge they do preferebly want someone with minimum 1 year expericense
  with either fullstack, backend or fronend development.
  and experience with the following languages:
      Laravel, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Linux, GitLab (Git)

  while experience with the following is an advantage
    Docker, Node, Angular, React, Vue

Now of course i whould not consider myself an idiot, but considering me beliving this whould be my dream jobb,
  I think it is worth doing the best i can.



Now that youre informed about my ambitions and the situation i am inn
  I belive i can share my plan;)
  
  Currently the plan is to start with 30 days to javascript   https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript
    and use github in order to share my progress and stay motivated.
    I have also thought about streaming for extra motivation.
